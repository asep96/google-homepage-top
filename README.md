For this project, I will make a webpage resembling the Google 
homepage, as part of the curriculum on The Odin Project. The link can be found 
here: (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

In this project, I used HTML and CSS. While the page was is not identical, 
it does look similar, which is important. None of the buttons or features
you'd normally see work, but that is okay given this assignment. I feel that 
some of my code was redundant and could certainly be improved upon. This being 
said, when I become more skilled at HTML and CSS, I will revist this assignment
and fix the code in it. This is my first completed project, and I am quite 
excited to keep going!
